    <h1>Code Blog: Reflecting on My Assignment</h1>
    
    <p> For the first assignment of the term  I needed to make a webpage through github that allowed me to display some basic information about myself aswell as a picture. One of the main obsticals that I had was getting the image to display properly on my Github site. </p>
  
    <p> When I first uploaded the image to the repository I hadnt created a website before so I wasnt sure how exactly I was going to make a image show up on a page but with a quick google search I was able to find how to attach it. </p>
    
    <p>Through troubleshooting, I learned the importance of making sure that the image URL points to the correct location especially when working with GitHub Pages. I also realized that GitHub can take a few minutes to update changes on a live page, so sometimes patience is part of the process.</p>
    
    <p>The most useful resources for me during this project were the internet and my friends. I relied heavily on the internet and youtube to teach me the basics of html coding which provided answers into fixing the image issue and ensuring my site was correctly set up. In addition to online resources my friends helped by giving me tips and helping me test the site after each change I made.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, while this assignment presented some hurdles, it was a good experiance. I now feel much more prepared for future web development tasks and troubleshooting issues that arise along the way.</p>
